# Fast Watch
Void watch rift sniper

The intention of this addon is to snipe the rift in the presence of competition or other bots. Priority is on speed, therefore cell and displacer trading is not supported. You are expected to be able to battle at full strength and to rely on an active voidwatch campaign for lights.

There is no auto looting in this version.

If you need trading or box looting, use the original voidwatch bot instead.

Start watching for the rift:
> fw start

Important: Fast watch expects a full group and will NOT start the encounter if you do not have 6 party members. Fill the group out with trusts if needed.

Unlike the original voidwatch addon, you may leave fastwatch running at all times and through zoning, without issue.
